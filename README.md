# Data Science Internship Task 2 - Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview
Task-02: Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Project Details

### Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Description:** The dataset provides information on the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including features such as age, gender, ticket class, and survival status.

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Jupyter Lab:** Environment for developing and running the analysis.
- **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization and exploring relationships between variables.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.

### Key Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning:** 
   - Handle missing data and outliers.
   - Format and preprocess data for analysis.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize the distribution of variables.
   - Explore correlations between features like age, gender, class, and survival status.
   - Identify patterns and trends within the dataset.

## Findings

- **Survival Rates:** Analysis revealed that women and children had higher survival rates, while passengers in higher ticket classes were more likely to survive.
- **Correlation Insights:** Features such as age, passenger class, and gender showed strong correlations with survival, providing valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.

## Conclusion

This project significantly enhanced my skills in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). By working with the Titanic dataset, I was able to identify key patterns and trends, such as the correlation between passenger class, gender, and survival rates. The insights gained from this analysis not only deepened my understanding of data manipulation and visualization techniques but also provided practical experience in deriving meaningful conclusions from real-world datasets.

This task has been instrumental in strengthening my ability to work with complex datasets and effectively communicate findings through clear and impactful visualizations.
